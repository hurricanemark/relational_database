# Building A Bike Rental Shop Database

This exercise emphasizes on relational database topics of one-to-one, on-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

You will walk away with a clearer understanding of efficient table creation and querying for JOIN logics.

The best way I know how to understand relational tables is by visualizing the Venn diagrams with shaded areas.

This has been a good exercise.

Thanks FCC!
