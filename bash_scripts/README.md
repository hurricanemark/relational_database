# Bash Scripting

Since I have worked with terminal for many years, this exercise started out tedious.  However, it proved to be a rewarding effort at the end.  I picked up a few more tricks and reenforced some, as well as corrected a few of my ingrain misconceptions on certain linux commands.

Mostly, `help [[` shows me more info than I could find googling.

Thanks FCC!
